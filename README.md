# ReSelect
A helper tool to extract sample relatedness from huge relatedness matrix and also calculates the mean relatedness among the selected samples
# Background
This software is developed to handle the large GRM matrix generated by PLINK on UKBB samples, use as part of my simulation.
A key feature is the ability to extract a portion of the GRM with different samples as rows and columns.

If you just want to extract a squared matrix with same sample as rows and columns, you can simply ignore the `--target` parameter. 

# Available Options
 - `--input` | `-i` Relatedness matrix file
 - `--id` | `-d` Relatedness ID file
 - `--base` | `-b` Base Sample IDs
 - `--target` | `-t` Target Sample IDs
 - `--out` | `-o` Output Prefix
 - `--help` | `-h` Display this help messag
    
# Outputs
4 output files will be generated
1. \<Output\>.matrix - The extracted GRM matrix
2. \<Output\>.row - Sample ID for each row of the GRM matrix
3. \<Output\>.col - Sample ID for each col of the GRM matrix
4. \<Output\>.avg - File containing the statistic of the GRM matrix, i.e. Mean, SD and Variance
